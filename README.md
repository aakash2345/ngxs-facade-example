# Ngxs Facade Example

You can visit to the **Facade** [Demo App](https://offwork.github.io/ngxs-facade-example/).

> In my personal experience, the `fa√ßade` pattern assumes the relationship between the component and the store and reduces the code density in both the component and the store. Also, as in the code, reducing data binding to the template improves the readability of the template.
